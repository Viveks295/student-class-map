# Student Class Map

### Overview
The Student Class Map is a convenient application designed to assist users in finding the most efficient route between buildings. With this user-friendly app, you have the option to load a DOT file containing building information or easily add locations and pathways directly within the application. By employing the reliable Dijkstra's algorithm, the program effortlessly calculates the shortest path available. To help you get started, I've included a sample DOT file called `UW_MAP.dot`, which features various buildings on the UW-Madison campus along with the corresponding walking durations in minutes. Discover the campus effortlessly and optimize your navigation experience with the Student Class Map!

### Get Started
To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands
```
cd app
make
```
From there, you can load the example DOT file
```
L
UW_map.dot
```
